# Contributing Guidelines

It's great to see that you're taking the time to read this. Let's have some fun together! 

By default, there are no restrictions on your imagination - feel free to do anything that you consider appropriate and are capable of doing. However, in the event that something negative occurs, we should make a note of it and document it in this file to prevent it from happening again. 

If you're interested in setting up the CALM development environment, please refer to the [Hacking](hacking.md) section.

## Making Changes

- To ensure proper code management, please refrain from pushing commits directly to the main branch.
- Instead, submit all changes through a pull request.
- Please note that a pull request must receive approval from code owners before it can be merged.
  As a counterexample, please check https://github.com/VitoVan/calm/pull/163.
