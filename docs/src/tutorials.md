# Tutorials

These tutorials need some basic Lisp knowledge.

But you can always copy and paste the code to have fun with.

## How to Use

To run those code, you need a file named `canvas.lisp`.

### Modifying a Sample Application

If you are [modifying a CALM Sample Application](getting-started.md), the file already exists, just modify it and restart the application.

### Useing CALM command

If you have [installed CALM](installation.md) and about to use it, please create a file in whatever directory you like, and change to that directory, run command `calm`, like this:

```bash
mkdir my-cool-app
cd my-cool-app
touch canvas.lisp # open this file in your editor
calm
```


I hope you enjoy.
